  title: Outage Management
  description: >-
    The Outage Management API provides a standardized client interface to Outage Management Systems
    for creating, tracking and managing outages as a result of a change request or incident
    identified. The API supports the ability to send requests to create a new Outage specifying the
    nature and impact of the Outage as well as all necessary related information. The API also
    includes mechanisms to search for and update existing Outages. Notifications are defined to
    provide information when an Outage has been updated, including state changes. A set of states of
    an Outage has been specified to handle the lifecycle management.
