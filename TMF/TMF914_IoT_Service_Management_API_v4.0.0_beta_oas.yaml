    EntitySpecification:
      description: |-
        EntitySpecification is a class that offers characteristics to describe a type of entity. Entities are generic constructs that may be used to describe bespoke business entities that are not effectively covered by the existing SID model.
        Functionally, the entity specification acts as a template by which entities may be instantiated and described. By sharing the same specification, these entities would therefore share the same set of characteristics.
        Note: The ‘configurable’ attribute on the specCharacteristics determines if an entity instantiated from the entity specification can override the value of the attribute. When set to false, the entity instance may not define a value that differs from the value in the specification.

    ResourceSpecificationRef:
      description: |-
        Resources are physical or non-physical components (or some combination of these) within an enterprise's infrastructure or inventory. They are typically consumed or used by services (for example a physical port assigned to a service) or contribute to the realization of a Product (for example, a SIM card). They can be drawn from the Application, Computing and Network domains, and include, for example, Network Elements, software, IT systems, content and information, and technology components.
        A ResourceSpecification is an abstract base class for representing a generic means for implementing a particular type of Resource. In essence, a ResourceSpecification defines the common attributes and relationships of a set of related Resources, while Resource defines a specific instance that is based on a particular ResourceSpecification.
